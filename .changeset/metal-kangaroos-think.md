update `@typescript-eslint/*` to v6

The `typescript` config now extends from the new typescript-eslint v6 `strict-type-checked` and `stylistic-type-checked` configs. This enables some rules that were not previously enforced, disables some rules that were previously too strict, and may enforce some new stylistic preferences.
